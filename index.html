            <h2>Dracula</h2>

            <div>

                <p>"He was there too. He must 'a' started off and got there afore me, for when I rung of the bell he kem
                    an' opened the door 'isself an' 'elped me to carry the boxes into the 'all."</p>

                <p>"The whole nine?" I asked.</p>

                <p>"Yus; there was five in the first load an' four in the second. It was main dry work, an' I don't so
                    well remember 'ow I got 'ome." I interrupted him:--</p>

                <p>"Were the boxes left in the hall?"</p>

                <p>"Yus; it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it." I made one more attempt to further
                    matters:--</p>

                <p>"You didn't have any key?"</p>

                <p>"Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door 'isself an' shut it again when I
                    druv off. I don't remember the last time--but that was the beer."</p>

                <p>"And you can't remember the number of the house?"</p>

                <p>"No, sir. But ye needn't have no difficulty about that. It's a 'igh 'un with a stone front with a bow
                    on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door. I know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three
                    loafers what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin's, an' they seein' they got
                    so much, they wanted more; but 'e took one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down
                    the steps, till the lot of them went away cussin'." I thought that with this description I could
                    find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started off for Piccadilly. I had
                    gained a new painful experience; the Count could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If
                    so, time was precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution, he could, by
                    choosing his own time, complete the task unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and
                    walked westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house described, and was
                    satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had
                    been long untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were up. All the
                    framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away. It was evident
                    that up to lately there had been a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been
                    roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining. Behind the rails of the
                    balcony I saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good
                    deal to have been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to
                    the ownership of the house. I remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax,
                    and I could not but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means discovered
                    of gaining access to the house.</p>

                <p>There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and nothing could be done; so I
                    went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active,
                    the Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom
                    I saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it
                    had lately been taken, but he couldn't say from whom. He told me, however, that up to very lately
                    there had been a notice-board of "For Sale" up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house
                    agents, could tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the
                    board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know or guess too much, so, thanking
                    him in the usual manner, I strolled away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing
                    in, so I did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a
                    directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in Sackville Street.</p>
